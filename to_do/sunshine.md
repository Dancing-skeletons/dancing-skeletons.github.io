## Paroles:

### Couplet
The other [C]night dear, as I lay [C7]sleeping  
I dreamed I [F]held you in my [C]arms  
But when I [F]awoke, dear, I was [(C Am)]mistaken  
So I hung [(C G7)]my head and I [C]cried.  

:::highlight
### Refrain
You are my [C]sunshine, my only sunshine[C7]  
You make me [F]happy when skies are [C]gray  
You'll never [F]know dear, how much I [(C Am)]love you  
Please don't [(C G7)]take my sunshine [C]away  
:::


I'll always [C]love you and make you [C7]happy,  
If you will [F]only say the [C]same.  
But if you [F]leave me and love [(C Am)]another,  
You'll [(C G7)]regret it all some [C]day.  

:::highlight
### Refrain
:::

You told me [C]once, dear, you really [C7]loved me  
And no one [F]else could come [C]between.  
But now [F]you've left me and love [(C Am)]another;  
You have [(C G7)]shattered all of my [C]dreams:  

:::highlight
### Refrain
:::

In all my [C]dreams, dear, you seem to [C7]leave me  
When I awake [F]my poor heart [C]pains.  
So when you [F]come back and make [(C Am)]me happy  
I'll [(C G7)]forgive you dear, I'll take all the [C]blame.
