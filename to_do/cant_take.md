## Paroles:

### Couplet 1
You're just too [C] good to be true
Can't take my [Cmaj7] eyes off you
You'd be like [C7] heaven to touch
I wanna [F] hold you so much
At long last [Fm] love has arrived
And I thank [C] God I'm alive
You're just too [(D7)] good to be true
[(Fm)] Can't take my [C] eyes off you [C]

### Couplet 2
Pardon the [C] way that I stare
There's nothing [Cmaj7] else to compare
The sight of [C7] you leaves me weak
There are no [F] words left to speak
So if you [Fm] feel like I feel
Please let me [C] know that it's real
You're just too [(D7)] good to be true
[(Fm)] Can't take my [C] eyes off you [C]
[X]I [X]love [X]you

(I love you) [Dm] baby and if it's [G7] quite all right

when I [Cmaj7] say [Am]
Oh pretty [Dm] baby, don't bring me [G7] down I pray
