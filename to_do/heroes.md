[D]I - I wish you could [G]swim
Like the [D]dolphins - like dolphins can [G]swim

### Couplet
[D]I - I will be [G]King
And [D]you - you will be [G]Queen

We can be [Am]Heroes [Em]just for one [D]day
We can be [C]us [G] just for one [D]day

### Couplet
[D]I - I can re[G]member (I remember)
[D]Standing by the [G]wall (By the wall)
And the [D]guards shot a[G]bove our heads (Over our heads)
And we [D]kissed as though nothing would [G]fall (Nothing could fall)

### Pont
And the [C]shame was on the [D]other side
Oh we can [Am]beat them fore[Em]ver and [D]ever
Then we can be [C]Heroes [G] just for one [D]day
