### Couplet: Uniquement un ↓ par accord.
[F]I see the [E7]crystal raindrops [Am]fall  
And the [C7]beauty of it all  
[F]Is when the [E7]sun comes shining [Am]through [Am]  
[F]To make those [E7]rainbows in my [Am]mind  
When I [C7]think of you sometime  
[F]And I wanna [E7]spend some time with [Am]you

### Refrain
Just the [F]two of us[E7]  
We can [Am]make it if we [C7]try  
Just the [F]two of us[E7]  
(Just the [Am]two of us)[Am]  
Just the [F]two of us[E7]  
Building [Am]castles in the [C7]sky  
Just the [F]two of us[E7]  
You and I[Am Am]

### Couplet
[F]We look for [E7]love, no time for [Am]tears  
Wasted [C7]water's all that [F]is  
And it don't [E7]make no flowers [Am]grow [Am]  
[F]Good things might [E7]come to those who [Am]wait  
Not for [C7]those who wait too [F]late  
We gotta [E7]go for all we [Am]know [Am]

### Couplet
[F]I see the [E7]crystal raindrops [Am]fall  
On the [C7]window down the [F]hall  
And it be[E7]comes the morning [Am]dew [Am]  
[F]And darling [E7]when the morning [Am]comes  
And I [C7]see the morning [F]sun  
I wanna [E7]be the one with [Am]you [Am]
