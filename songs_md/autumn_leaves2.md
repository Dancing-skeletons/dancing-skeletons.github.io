## Paroles:


[Dm]The falling [Gm7] leaves [C7] drift by the [Fmaj7] window
[Bbmaj7]The Autumn [Gm6] leaves [A7]
of red and [Dm] gold
I  see your [Gm7] lips, [C7] the summer [Fmaj7] kisses
The [Bbmaj7] sun-burned [Gm6] hands [A7]
I used to [Dm] hold

[Dm]Since you went [Gm6]away [A7]
the days grow [Dm] long
[Dm] And soon I'll [Gm7] hear
[C7] old winter's [Fmaj7] song
[Fmaj7] But I [Gm6] miss you most of [A7] all
my [Dm] dar-ling [Dm]
When [Gm6] Au-tumn [A7] leaves 
start to [Dm] fall
