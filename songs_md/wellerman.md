## Paroles:

### Couplet
There [Em]once was a ship that [Em]put to sea  
And the [Am]name of the ship was the [Em]Billy of Tea  
The [Em]winds blew up, her [Em]bow dipped down  
[B7]Blow, my bully boys, [Em]blow (huh)  
 
:::highlight
### Refrain
[C]Soon may the [G]Wellerman come  
To [Am]bring us sugar and [Em]tea and rum  
[C]One day, when the [G]tonguin' is done  
We'll [B7]take our leave and [Em]go  
:::

### Couplet
She [Em]had not been two [Em]weeks from shore  
When [Am]down on her a [Em]right whale bore  
The [Em]captain called all [Em]hands and swore  
He'd [B7]take that whale in [Em]tow  

:::highlight
### Refrain
:::

### Couplet
Before [Em]the boat had hit [Em]the water  
The [Am]whale's tail came [Em]up and caught her  
All [Em]hands to the side [Em]harpooned and fought her  
When [B7]she dived down [Em]below (huh)  

:::highlight
### Refrain
:::

### Couplet
No [Em]line was cut, no whale [Em]was freed  
The [Am]Captain's mind was [Em]not of greed  
But [Em]he belonged to the [Em]whaleman's creed  
She [B7]took that ship in [Em]tow (Huh!)  

:::highlight
### Refrain
:::

### Couplet
For [Em]forty days, or [Em]even more  
The [Am]line went slack, then [Em]tight once more  
All [Em]boats were lost, there were [Em]only four  
But [B7]still that whale did [Em]go (Huh!)  

:::highlight
### Refrain
:::

As [Em]far as I've heard, the fight's [Em]still on  
The [Am]line's not cut and the [Em]whale's not gone  
The [Em]Wellerman makes his [Em]regular call  
To [Am]encourage the Captain, [Em]crew, and all (Huh!)
