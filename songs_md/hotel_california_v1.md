### Couplet

[Am]On a dark desert highway, [E7] Cool wind in my hair  
[G]Warm smell of colitas, [D] Rising up through the air  
[F]Up ahead in the distance, [C] I saw a shimmering light  
[Dm]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, [E7] I had to stop for the [E7/ ]night

[Am]There she stood in the doorway, [E7] I heard the mission bell  
[G]And I was thinking to myself, [D] This could be heaven or this could be hell  
[F]Then she lit up a candle, [C] And she showed me the way  
[Dm]There were voices down the corridor, [E7] I thought I heard them [E7/]say

### Refrain

[F]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia  
Such a [E7]lovely place, such a lovely place, Such a [Am]lovely face  
[F]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia  
Any [Dm]time of year, any time of year, You can [E7]find it [E7/]here

### Couplet

[Am]Her mind is Tiffany twisted, [E7]She got the Mercedes bends  
[G]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, [D]That she calls friends  
[F]How they dance in the courtyard, [C]Sweet summer sweat  
[Dm]Some dance to remember, [E7]Some dance to for[E7/]get

[Am]So I called up the captain, [E7]"Please bring me my wine" (he said)  
[G]"We haven't had that spirit here, Since [D]1969"  
[F]And still those voices are calling from [C]far away  
[Dm]Wake you up in the middle of the night, [E7]Just to hear them [E7/]say

::: highlight

### Refrain

[F]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia  
Such a [E7]lovely place, such a lovely place, Such a [Am]lovely face  
They [F]livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia  
What a [Dm]nice surprise, what a nice surprise,  Bring your [E7]alibis [E7/ (laisser sonner)]

### Couplet (en arpège (4321))

[Am]Mirrors on the ceiling, [E7]The pink champagne on ice, and she said  
[G]"We are all just prisoners here, [D]of our own device"  
[F]And in the master's chambers, They [C]gathered for the feast  
They [Dm /]stab it with their steely knives, But they just [E7///]can't kill the [E7/]beast

### Couplet

[Am]Last thing I remember, [E7]I was running for the door  
[G]I had to find the passage back, [D]to the place I was before  
[F]"Relax" said the nightman, [C]"We are programmed to receive  
[Dm]You can check out anytime you like, But [E7]you can never [E7 /]leave"
