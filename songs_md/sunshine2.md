### Intro
Solo

### Couplet
The other [C]night dear, as I lay [(C C7)]sleeping  
I dreamed I [F]held you in my [C]arms  
But when I [F]awoke, dear, I was [(C Am)]mistaken  
So I hung [(C G7)]my head and I [C]cried.  

:::highlight
### Refrain
You are my [C]sunshine, my only sunshine[(C C7)]  
You make me [F]happy when skies are [C]gray  
You'll never [F]know dear, how much I [(C Am)]love you  
Please don't [(C G7)]take my sunshine [C]away

### Couplet
I'll always [C]love you and make you [(C C7)]happy,  
If you will [F]only say the [C]same.  
But if you [F]leave me and love [(C Am)]another,  
You'll [(C G7)]regret it all some [C]day.
